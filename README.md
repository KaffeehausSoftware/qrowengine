# qrowengine
Qrow Engine is a small, fast, and easy-to-use game engine made in Lua and SDL2.

It's entirely contained in one file, meaning it's easily portable.

Created and maintained by Kappa.

## News, Updates, and Other Things

### v1.5.3 is out

- the TTF module has been added.

### Qrow has been moved to this very repo!

Kaffeehaus Software is pleased to announce that Qrow Engine is now part of our toolbelt.
